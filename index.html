            <h3>Hey There</h3>
            <p>I am Digant Singh, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                and Engineering. I am currently in my second year. I am interested in Data
                Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have been working 
                towards upskilling myself in the field.</p>
            <p>I am deeply fascinated by 
                the world of data science and artificial intelligence. The ability to 
                harness data to extract meaningful insights, solve complex problems, and 
                create intelligent systems is awe-inspiring. What excites me most is the 
                potential for these technologies to transform industries, improve healthcare, 
                address environmental challenges, and enhance our daily lives. I am committed 
                to not only learning the intricacies of data science and AI but also contributing 
                to their growth and ethical development. This field offers endless opportunities for 
                innovation, and I am eager to be a part of the exciting journey towards a 
                data-driven future where AI can make a positive impact on society.</p>
            <p>The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and I wish to contribute in it.
                I wish to do so by working in research as well as in the industry.

                    Stress for Students in the Modern World</h4>
                <h5>Undertaken by Digant Singh</h5>
                <p>This research explores the link between playing
                    digital games and stress reduction among students across
                    diverse educational levels. The study investigates optimal 
                    gaming duration for stress reduction. </p>

                <h4>From Data Mining to Knowlege Discovery in Databases</h4>
                <p>In the world of data science and analytics, the phrase "From Data 
                    Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases" is crucial. It symbolizes 
                    the process of gleaning significant patterns, trends, and insights 
                    from huge datasets. While knowledge discovery focuses on turning raw 
                    data into usable knowledge, data mining uses a variety of techniques 
                    to unearth buried information. Making educated decisions, seeing 
                    possibilities, and developing a deeper understanding of complicated 
                    datasets are all made possible through this approach, which 
                    ultimately promotes innovation and well-informed decision-making 
                    across a variety of industries.</p>

                <h4>Data Science Fundamentals by IBM</h4>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive Data Science course offered 
                    by IBM, which includes a certification upon completion. This course 
                    has been a transformative learning experience, equipping me with a 
                    profound understanding of data analysis, machine learning, and 
                    data-driven decision-making. The IBM certification not only validates 
                    my skills but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and 
                    professional development. I believe this knowledge will significantly 
                    enhance my capabilities in conducting research and contribute to my 
                    effectiveness in generating data-driven insights in my future
