            <h3>Hey There</h3>
            <p>I am Digant Singh, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                and Engineering. I am currently in my second year. I am interested in Data
                Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have been working 
                towards upskilling myself in the field.</p>
            <p>I am deeply fascinated by 
                the world of data science and artificial intelligence. The ability to 
                harness data to extract meaningful insights, solve complex problems, and 
                create intelligent systems is awe-inspiring. What excites me most is the 
                potential for these technologies to transform industries, improve healthcare, 
                address environmental challenges, and enhance our daily lives. I am committed 
                to not only learning the intricacies of data science and AI but also contributing 
                to their growth and ethical development. This field offers endless opportunities for 
                innovation, and I am eager to be a part of the exciting journey towards a 
                data-driven future where AI can make a positive impact on society.</p>
            <p>The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and I wish to contribute in it.
                I wish to do so by working in research as well as in the industry.
